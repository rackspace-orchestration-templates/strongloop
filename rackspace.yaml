instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  This deployment provides a single Linux server with Node.js and the
  StrongLoop command-line tool installed.

  Once the deployment is complete, the LoopBack sample application is available
  in the loopback-example-app sub-directory of your home directory. To access
  the sample application, navigate to the IP address of the server on port 3000
  (for example, https://1.2.3.4:3000). For more information, see the [LoopBack
  documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/DOC/LoopBack).

  To create your own application, SSH to the server using the user and password
  provided and follow the guides below. See
  [docs.strongloop.com](http://docs.strongloop.com/) for more information about
  StrongLoop Suite. Additionally, the private key provided in the passwords
  section can be used to login as root via SSH. For information on how to use
  SSH keys, please see these tutorials for [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  and [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
